<center>Hi,  I'm Brian and I enjoy every single aspect of programming</center>

I've lived in New England my entire life, and I'm currently in New Hampshire. I'm currently fully invested in learning Python and Django, while simultaneously expanding my skills in Java. I've worked in both a waterfall and scrum environment, and I've touched every part of the software development life cycle.

My programming life all started in 10th grade, when I had the opportunity to take a Visual Basic course. 

I was hooked. Throughout high school, I jumped around between Visual Basic and small basic, before landing on Java just before College. 

During College, I worked with a number of languages, primarily C, C++, and Java.  I took two internships, one as a Java developer, and one as a Web developer. 

Since College, I've been working as a Java developer for over a year and a half, and have been working on Web Development in my spare time.

## Personal

I like to take on a lot of personal projects. I like to think that you can make almost any project you think of, you just have to learn the right skill set. I enjoy learning, and I'm always looking to learn new things.  When I get excited about an idea, it's very easy for me to become fully invested in it.

My most recent project started as an idea that I wanted to shut off the lights, but I didn't want to get up. This led me down a rabbit hole of learning the Raspberry Pi, Apache Web Server, Android Development, and a whole slew of new Unix commands.
