<center>Hi,  I'm Brian and I enjoy every single aspect of programming</center>

I've lived in New England my entire life, and I'm currently in New Hampshire. I'm currently fully invested in learning Python and Django, while simultaneously expanding my skills in Java. I've worked in both a waterfall and scrum environment, and I've touched every part of the software development life cycle.

My programming life all started in 10th grade, when I had the opportunity to take a Visual Basic course. 

I was hooked. Throughout high school, I jumped around between Visual Basic and small basic, before landing on Java just before College. 

During College, I worked with a number of languages, primarily C, C++, and Java.  I took two internships, one as a Java developer, and one as a Web developer. 

Since College, I've been working as a Java developer for over a year and a half, and have been working on Web Development in my spare time.


## Professional

Summer 2014: I worked at Fideliy Investments in Boston, working as an Intern Java developer on a scrum team. The work involved heavy usage of Spring Web MVC framework, Apache Maven, and Java / Javascript. While I was there, I was able to create a RESTful service, capable of displaying the status of different parts of the project.

September 2014 - Summer 2015: I worked at a local startup company in Providence, working as a Web developer. I was able to get a large amount of experience in Javascript, Bootstrap, Node.js, Ajax, Umbraco, and JQuery, while gaining knowledge on the best practices of web development.

Summer 2015- Current: I'm currently working at Raytheon, first in Rhode Island, now in Massachusetts. I've been working primarily in Java. I've also been able to gain a large amount of Unix experience as well. I have been a member of a Scrumban team and a Waterfall team.

Summer 2016: As a side project, I've been developing websites for local companies in Django.  I'm using this as a way for me to be able to apply my experience with Javascript and Bootstrap, and hopefully progress towards a Python or Web development career.


## Personal

I like to take on a lot of personal projects. I like to think that you can make almost any project you think of, you just have to learn the right skill set. I enjoy learning, and I'm always looking to learn new things.  When I get excited about an idea, it's very easy for me to become fully invested in it.

My most recent project started as an idea that I wanted to shut off the lights, but I didn't want to get up. This led me down a rabbit hole of learning the Raspberry Pi, Apache Web Server, Android Development, and a whole slew of new Unix commands.
